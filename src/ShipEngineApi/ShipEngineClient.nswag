We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a\r\n    first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible\r\n    prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with\r\n    each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Getting Started\r\n\r\n    If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to\r\n    REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics.\r\n    Learn how to [authenticate yourself to\r\n    ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our\r\n    [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the\r\n    tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be\r\n    sure to check the [error handling\r\n    guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:\r\n\r\n      - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)\r\n      - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)\r\n      - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)\r\n      - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier\r\n\r\n    ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any\r\n    carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and\r\n    [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a\r\n    [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/).\r\n    You can even customize labels with your own\r\n    [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and\r\n    [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Real-Time Package Tracking\r\n\r\n    With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a\r\n    package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to\r\n    real-time tracking\r\n    updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks.\r\n    You can also create [custimized tracking\r\n    pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with\r\n    your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers\r\n\r\n    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates\r\n    across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/)\r\n    using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment\r\n    details yet, then you can [get rate\r\n    estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited\r\n    address info.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ## Worldwide Address Validation\r\n\r\n    ShipEngine supports [address\r\n    validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for\r\n    virtually [every country on\r\n    Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/),\r\n    including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany,\r\n    France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.\r\npaths:\r\n  /v1/addresses/recognize:\r\n    summary: Parse an address\r\n    description: >\r\n      Data often enters your system as unstructured text (for example: emails,\r\n      SMS messages, support tickets, or other documents).

The parsed shipment data is returned in the\r\n        same structure that's used for other ShipEngine APIs, so you can easily\r\n        use the parsed data to create a shipping label.\r\n\r\n\r\n        > **Note:** Shipment recognition is currently supported for the United\r\n        States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.\r\n      tags:\r\n        - shipments\r\n      operationId: parse_shipment\r\n      requestBody:\r\n        required: true\r\n        description: >\r\n          The only required field is `text`, which is the text to be parsed.

For example, if the substring \"john doe\" was recognized\r\n        as a \"person\" entity, then the value might be normalized to have proper\r\n        capitalization (e.g. \"John Doe\").
